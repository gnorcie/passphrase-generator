# passphrase-generator

WARNING: THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE - DO NOT USE IN CRITICAL APPLICATIONS.

This was meant to be a simple exercise exploring ways to use the secrets module introduced in Python 3.6 and may not be cryptographically secure.

Calling genPassphrase without arguments should send a 7 word passphrase to your paste buffer
(so far only tested on MacOS)

passphrase-generator requires python3 - if you have issues when you run "python genPassphrase.py" then check that you have python3 installed or invoke directly (python3 genPassphrase.py)
